# Live Activities with Ably — NBA Game Score Example

Drive iOS **Live Activities** (Lock Screen + Dynamic Island) from a Node.js
server using [Ably](https://ably.com) — no APNs plumbing on your server. The
example shows a live NBA game score: a dashboard in the browser pushes score
updates, and every subscribed iPhone updates in real time.

Ably holds your Apple APNs auth key (uploaded once in the Ably dashboard), so:

- the **server** needs only an Ably API key — no `.p8` files, no JWT signing,
  no direct APNs connections;
- the **iOS app** authenticates with Ably token auth via the server's
  `authUrl` endpoint — no API key ever reaches the device.

Both Live Activity flows are covered, end to end:

| Flow | What happens | Requires |
|---|---|---|
| **Broadcast updates** | The activity is started on-device and subscribes to an APNs broadcast channel; one push from the server updates *every* subscribed device at once | iOS 18+ |
| **Push-to-start** | The server starts a Live Activity remotely on devices that never opened the flow — targeted by Ably channel or device ID | iOS 17.2+ |

## How it works

```
┌────────────────┐   Ably push admin API   ┌────────┐   APNs    ┌─────────────────┐
│ Node dashboard │ ───────────────────────▶│  Ably  │ ─────────▶│ iPhone           │
│ (ably-js)      │  broadcast / start /    │        │  channel  │  Live Activity   │
│                │  update / end           │ holds  │  fan-out  │  (Lock Screen +  │
│  /api/auth ◀───┼─────────────────────────┼─ .p8 ──┼───────────┤   Dynamic Island)│
└────────────────┘   token auth (authUrl)  └────────┘           └─────────────────┘
```

1. The server creates an **APNs broadcast channel** through Ably and gets back
   a `{ id, apnsChannelId }` pair.
2. The iOS app either starts an activity locally subscribed to that
   `apnsChannelId` (`pushType: .channel`), or registers its **push-to-start
   token** with Ably so the server can start the activity remotely.
3. The dashboard calls Ably's push admin Live Activity API
   (`start` / `update` / `end`); Ably signs the APNs request with your `.p8`
   and APNs fans the update out to every subscribed device.

**SDK versions:** [ably-cocoa 1.2.62+](https://github.com/ably/ably-cocoa)
(Swift Package Manager) on iOS, [ably 2.24.0+](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ably)
(npm) on the server — the first releases with the Live Activity push admin and
push-to-start APIs.

## Prerequisites

- An **Apple Developer account** with an APNs auth key (`.p8`) — create one
  under Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles → Keys.
- A **physical iPhone** (push doesn't work in the Simulator), iOS 17.2+
  (iOS 18+ for broadcast channels).
- **Xcode 15+** and **Node.js 18+**.
- An **Ably account** ([free signup](https://ably.com/signup)).

## Step 1 — Configure Ably

1. Create an Ably app (or use an existing one).
2. In the app's **Push** settings, upload your APNs auth key: the `.p8`
   contents, Key ID, Team ID, and your app's bundle ID. Select the sandbox
   APNs endpoint for development builds.
3. Create an API key with the **Push Admin** capability.

That's the only place your Apple credentials live — the server never sees them.

## Step 2 — Run the server

```bash
cd server
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # set ABLY_API_KEY (and APPLE_BUNDLE_ID for the dashboard badge)
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

| `.env` variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ABLY_API_KEY` | Ably dashboard → your app → API Keys (needs Push Admin) |
| `APPLE_BUNDLE_ID` | Your app's bundle ID (shown in the dashboard badge) |
| `APNS_ENV` | `sandbox` / `production` (shown in the dashboard badge) |

## Step 3 — Build the iOS app

The Xcode project is included; open
`LiveActivityExample/LiveActivityExample.xcodeproj`, then:

1. **Signing & Capabilities** (main app target): set your team, make sure
   **Push Notifications** is added, and `aps-environment` is `development`.
2. Set the bundle ID to match what you configured in Ably's Push settings.
3. The **ably-cocoa** package (1.2.62, via SPM) resolves automatically on
   first open.
4. Build to a **physical device**.

If you're recreating the project from scratch instead, the important bits are:

- Two targets: the app and a Widget Extension (`MatchScoreWidget`).
- `Models/MatchAttributes.swift` must belong to **both** targets — it defines
  `GameAttributes`, the shared `ActivityAttributes` type. Its name is part of
  the wire contract: the server sends `attributes-type: "GameAttributes"`.
- `Info.plist` needs:
  ```xml
  <key>NSSupportsLiveActivities</key><true/>
  <key>NSSupportsLiveActivitiesFrequentUpdates</key><true/>
  ```
- Deployment target iOS 17.2+ on both targets.

## Tutorial A — Broadcast updates (one push, every device)

The activity is started **on the device**, subscribed to an APNs broadcast
channel; the dashboard then updates all subscribed devices with a single call.

1. In the dashboard, click **Create Broadcast**. You get two IDs:
   - **Broadcast ID** — the Ably handle used for update/end calls;
   - **APNS Channel ID** — what devices subscribe to.
2. In the iOS app, paste the **APNS Channel ID** into the *Broadcast Channel*
   field and tap **Start Live Activity Locally**. The activity starts with
   `pushType: .channel(apnsChannelId)`.
3. Back in the dashboard, change the points, period, clock, or last play and
   click **Send Update** — every subscribed device updates simultaneously.
   No per-device tokens are ever collected.
4. **End Activity** ends it everywhere (and invalidates the broadcast).

Repeat step 2 on more devices to see the fan-out: one `update()` call, all
screens change at once.

## Tutorial B — Push-to-start (server starts the activity remotely)

Here the device runs no activity at all — the server starts one on it via
Ably. This is the two-step device registration released in ably-cocoa 1.2.62.

**On the device (one-time setup):**

1. Launch the app. iOS issues a **push-to-start token** as soon as the app
   observes `Activity.pushToStartTokenUpdates`; it appears in the app UI.
2. Check the *Server URL* field points at your machine (the app authenticates
   through the server's `/api/auth` token endpoint — the Ably API key stays
   server-side).
3. Tap **Activate Device with Ably**. Under the hood this is two steps:
   `push.activate()` registers the device with Ably using a standard APNs
   token, then `push.registerPushToStartToken(_:)` attaches the Live Activity
   push-to-start token to that registration.
4. Subscribe the device to an Ably channel, e.g. `games:lal-bos` — this is how
   the server targets it. (The app also shows the **Ably Device ID** if you'd
   rather target one device directly.)

**From the dashboard:**

5. Click **Create Broadcast** (push-to-start also enrolls the new activity
   into a broadcast channel, so you can update it the same way as Tutorial A).
6. In *Start Live Activity*, enter the channel from step 4 (or paste the
   Device ID), set the teams, and click **Start Live Activity**.
7. The Live Activity appears on the device — even if the app is in the
   background — already subscribed to the broadcast. Use **Send Update** /
   **End Activity** as before.

## API reference

Everything the server does goes through the Ably JS SDK's push admin API:

```js
const rest = new Ably.Rest({ key: ABLY_API_KEY });

// 1. Create a broadcast channel → { id, apnsChannelId }
await rest.push.admin.createApnsBroadcast({ messageStoragePolicy: 1 });

// 2. Push-to-start on devices subscribed to a channel (or by deviceId)
await rest.push.admin.liveActivity.start({
  recipient: { channels: ['games:lal-bos'] },   // or { deviceId }
  apnsBroadcast: id,          // enroll the started activity into the broadcast
  apns: {
    aps: {
      event: 'start',
      'input-push-channel': apnsChannelId,
      'attributes-type': 'GameAttributes',      // must match the Swift type name
      attributes: { homeTeam, awayTeam },
      'content-state': { homeScore: 0, awayScore: 0, /* … */ },
      alert: { title: 'Lakers vs Celtics', body: 'Game starting!' },
      timestamp: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000),
    },
  },
  headers: { 'apns-priority': 10 },
});

// 3. Update / end all subscribed activities with one call
await rest.push.admin.liveActivity.update({ apnsBroadcast: id, apns, headers });
await rest.push.admin.liveActivity.end({ apnsBroadcast: id, apns, headers });
```

The `apns` field is a standard [APNs Live Activity payload](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/activitykit/starting-and-updating-live-activities-with-activitykit-push-notifications)
— Ably signs it and passes it through unchanged. `messageStoragePolicy: 1`
caches the last update so late-joining devices receive the current
content-state when they subscribe.

The token auth endpoint is a one-liner — the device's `authUrl` points here:

```js
app.get('/api/auth', async (req, res) => {
  res.json(await rest.auth.createTokenRequest({
    capability: JSON.stringify({ '*': ['subscribe', 'publish', 'push-subscribe'] }),
  }));
});
```

## Troubleshooting

- **No push-to-start token in the app** — push-to-start needs iOS 17.2+ and a
  physical device; the token only appears while
  `NSSupportsLiveActivities` is set and Live Activities are allowed for the
  app in Settings.
- **Activation fails with an auth error** — the device must reach the server's
  `/api/auth` over your local network; check the *Server URL* uses your Mac's
  hostname/IP, not `localhost`.
- **Updates don't arrive** — verify the APNs key in Ably's Push settings uses
  the **sandbox** endpoint for development builds, and that the bundle ID
  matches exactly.
- **Broadcast subscribe silently ignored** — `pushType: .channel` requires
  iOS 18+; on 17.x start the activity without a channel and use its
  per-activity update token instead.
